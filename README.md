# keymaster-client

keymaster-client is the client portion of the keymaster wireguard
key distribution solution. This readme is limited to configuration of
the keymaster-client daemon; for an overview and general information
please see [the keymaster-server repo(https://github.com/telus/keymaster-server).


## Configuration

By default, keymaster-client looks for configuration at the path
/etc/keymaster_client.yaml. You can change this by passing the desired
path in the `-f` or `--path-to-config` flags.

### Example Configuration

```
---
keymasterServer:
  url:
  networkName:
wg:
  configDir:
syncPeriod: 30
```

### Configuration Reference

**keymasterServer**

If present, indicates that the `keymasterServer` ConfigSource is to be used.
Cannot be used at the same time as the uDPUAPI ConfigSource.

**keymasterServer.url**

Required if `keymasterServer` is specified. The complete URL of the
keymaster-server deployment.

**keymasterServer.token**

Required if `keymasterServer` is specified. The token to use in requests to
the keymaster-server deployment. This token can be obtained from the
keymaster-server web UI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**uDPUAPI**

A ConfigSource for a proprietary system. Cannot be used at the same time as
the keymasterServer ConfigSource.

**uDPUAPI.url**

Required if `uDPUAPI` is specified. The complete URL of the uDPU API deployment.

**uDPUAPI.networkName**

Required if `uDPUAPI` is specified. The network name to request config for on the
uDPU API.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**uci**

A ConfigScheme that uses OpenWrt's UCI (Universal Configuration Interface) to
configure wireguard interfaces. Has no options. Cannot be used at the same time
as the `wg` ConfigScheme. For more information on UCI please see
[the OpenWrt wiki](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**wg**

A ConfigScheme that uses the `ip` and `wg` commands to configure wireguard
interfaces on the host running keymaster-client. Cannot be used at the same
time as the `wg` ConfigScheme.

**wg.configDir**

Optional; default: /var/lib/keymaster_client/

The directory in which configuration is stored after syncing with the
ConfigSource.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**privateKey**

Optional.

Allows you to specify the private key that this deployment of keymaster-client
will configure **all** interfaces with. This value takes precedence over any
values that otherwise would be generated by keymaster-client. This setting
is useful if you have multiple non-endpoint interfaces behind a load balancer that
you want to appear as a single highly-available interface to any endpoint
interfaces connecting to them. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**syncPeriod**

Optional. Default: 60

Lets you specify the interval, in seconds, at which keymaster-client requests
configuration from the ConfigSource.
